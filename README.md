# Credit-Score-Project

Project Scenario: Over the years, the company has collected basic bank details and gathered a lot of credit-related information. The management wants to build an intelligent system to segregate the people into credit score brackets to reduce the manual efforts.

Aim of the Project: Building a machine learning model that can classify the credit score, given a personâ€™s credit-related information. 

Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parisrohan/credit-score-classification 

This project requires the following libraries:
- Python 3.8+
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

Methodology:
- Data Cleaning: Performed advanced data preprocessing techniques like interquartile range (IQR) and KNN imputation for outlier and missing value treatment.
Created new features, such as Debt_Utilization, to enhance model performance. Applied a Decision Tree Classifier, with label encoding and feature standardization, to classify credit scores. Used train_test_split for model validation and performed cross-validation to ensure model reliability.
- Data Exploration: Visualized variables distribution through grephs, histograms and boxplots.
- Created new features, such as Debt_Utilization, to enhance model performance. Applied a Decision Tree Classifier, with label encoding and feature standardization, to classify credit scores. Used train_test_split for model validation and performed cross-validation to ensure model reliability.
-  Evaluated model accuracy with cross-validation, achieving consistent results. Visualized performance through a confusion matrix, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in real-world scenarios.
